A top-down visual attentional model for the Soar cognitive architecture [1]. Model integrates an adapted openCV implementation of the bottom-up visual saliency model in [2] with parametrized normalization for integrating an agent's top-down knowledge to create object specific saliency maps. The implemetation is inteded to be used as a ranking metric for object proposals to improve visual detection and identification. edgeBox [3] will be used for object proposal generation. 

Current Features used:
	- Color
	- Color Opponency
	- Orientation
	- Intensity
